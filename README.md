# EurKEY-Colemak
## What's different from Colemak?
Colemak is a great and ergonomic layout, but EurKEY has put much more work into sensible standards for special characters (at least for European languages). Colemak uses different special characters and layers. E.g.: Many European letters like Umlauts don't have a key, but are only typed using layers. Greek letters are completely absent, etc. 

## What's different from EurKEY?
Layer 0 has the base unmodded Colemak layout. On the Alt layer, i switched around some of the special characters, like thorn on Alt+f which is actually Alt+t in Colemak.

## Support
Only MacOS for now, not sure what standard to use for all OSs, suggestions welcome.
